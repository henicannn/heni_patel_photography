			        Magic happens when you turn your passion into profession. World works on confidence. If you are confident enough to create success from passion, you should hit it hard. I was born in India. I grew up in middle class family. I say destiny has its own plan. I studied like a normal guy till 12th in science stream. Science wasn't my field of interest. Details of nature attracted me more. I started my photography from mobile camera. Due to my interest in capturing moments of life with full details people started loving my photography. I was having some ausience to applause me. And all I needed was spark to create forest fire in my life.

	    		I got my first DSLR when I was in 12th grade. I was going to opt for software development but somehow Interactive Media Development caught my sight. This was the course which was going to enhance my photography skills and would help to transform my passion into profession. I went with this course and here I am today building my very own website of photography. I got to learn more about photography, designing and building a website. It tastes really yummy when you cook your dish with your very own self planted ingredients.
